    Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation

    A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited
    to just dictionary words.

    EXAMPLE
    Input: Tact Coa
    Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)

    EXAMPLE
    pale, ple -> true pales, pale -> true pale, bale -> true pale, bake -> false
